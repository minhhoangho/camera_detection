# .shellcheckrc

# ~~~~ WARNING for Developers of the `dotfiles` Repo Only ~~~~
#
# `shellcheck` checks `$PWD` & each parent directory until it finds a
# `.shellcheckrc` file. That means changes made to this file will override
# `~/.shellcheckrc` within this repo.
#
# The overriding is complete, and isnâ€™t just a merge. `~/.shellcheckrc` will be
# COMPLETELY ignored. Bearing this in mind makes development on this file
# easier.
